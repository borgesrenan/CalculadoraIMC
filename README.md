# ðŸ“± BMI Calculator â€“ Kotlin Android App

This is my first Android project built using **Kotlin**: a simple and functional **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator**.

The app allows users to input their weight and height, calculate their BMI, and view the result along with a **health classification** (like "Healthy Weight", "Overweight", etc.) and a **personalized message with recommendations**.

- Health classification based on the official BMI table
